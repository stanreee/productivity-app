- you can make multiple different kinds of activities
    - i.e. an activity for playing piano, programming, doing homework, studying, etc.

        - for each activity you set a certain length of time that you don't want to be interrupted for

- if you want to start a certain activity, you simply tap that activity then start the timer for that specific activity, and you will no longer receive notifications
depending how long the timer is for that specific activity

- at the end of the length of time, it gives you a summary of how long you were distracted for
